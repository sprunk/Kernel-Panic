## Kernel Panic, updated for Recoil

This repo contains the game archive for Kernel Panic, the simple RTS with no resources other than time.
It is an import of version 4.9 (based on Spring 105) with a bunch of changes made for Recoil compatibility.
Check [the game's own readme](Kernel_Panic_readme.txt) for more "official" info.

### Organisational stuff

After the engine fork, Recoil needed a good game for new devs to check out, and I remembered KP as being reasonably simple yet having a lot of cool features showcasing the engine's power (and I just like it as a game) so I decided to make it run on Recoil.
I talked to zwzsg and he didn't seem to mind.
In hindsight KP isn't actually a good newbie dev resource for various reasons but I still plan to keep it updated because it's good exposition.
I do not plan to do anything other than technical maintenance of the game archive though (no installer bundle, FOSS marketing etc).
